# Responsive Landing Page
Create a responsive landing page based on a provided Figma or image design.

This project is a **responsive landing page** built from a provided Figma or image design. **Since the task is not clear enough, I have created a hybrid page that has all the required secions, followig task requirements, but much more.** <br>

It is inspired by the Figma design, some parts are same, some are new. The other tasks are implemented in this task, as well as in separate repositories. I wanted to demonstrate frontend development skills,  responsive layout, code structure, and attention to details.
