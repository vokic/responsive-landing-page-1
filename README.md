# Responsive Landing Page
Create a responsive landing page based on a provided Figma or image design.

This project is a **responsive landing page** built from a provided Figma or image design. **Since the task is not clear enough, I have created a hybrid page that has all the required secions, followig task requirements, but much more.** <br>

It is inspired by the Figma design, some parts are same, some are new. The other tasks are implemented in this task, as well as in separate repositories. I wanted to demonstrate frontend development skills,  responsive layout, code structure, and attention to details.

## 🏗️ Sections and structure
- Hero section
- Features section
- CTA section
- FAQ Accordion
- Footer
- Many more

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For semantic and structured markup
- **CSS3** – For styling and responsive layout
- **JavaScript (optional/minimal)** – For accordion only
- Used **media queries** to adapt layout for different screens
- _Personally I would use a framework since the files are getting larger, and Tailwind utility classes or UI library for styling (Shadcn)_
